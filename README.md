# OutputWindow
I have created input and output Windows applications which are a custom made java windows designed to take input from user or display some information as output to the user. They can be used in any project by anyone. They have been designed and written by using Java Swing Components like Jarea, Jlabel, Jbutton, Jframe etc. I have also used notifyAll() method to make an application wait for users input
